# Physical-Adversarial-Attacks-on-Deep-Learning-based-ISP-Pipelines
In this work, we will design a physical patch-based or light-projection-based adversarial attack against state-of-the-art deep learning-based ISP models and evaluate the performance of object detection models using these processed images.
